\title{Write a taxa map by joining input taxa with ITIS data}
\usage{
write_taxa_map(taxa_df, taxa_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa_df}{A data frame containing taxa names to be mapped.}

\item{taxa_col}{The unquoted column name in \code{taxa_df} containing the
taxa names.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the taxa map data frame (also written to
\code{taxa_map.csv}).
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame of taxa names and joins them
with ITIS data from a local taxadb database, producing a standardized taxa
map suitable for downstream workflows. The function preserves input order,
checks for duplicate matches and row count consistency (with warnings), and
writes the result to \code{taxa_map.csv}.
}
\details{
The function uses helper functions to connect to the taxadb
database, retrieve the ITIS table, and determine the correct table name. It
uses \code{taxadb::clean_names()} to standardize input names and
\code{dplyr} for data manipulation. Validation is performed using
\code{pointblank} to warn about duplicate matches and row count mismatches.

\examples{
\dontrun{
sample_taxa <- data.frame(scientific_name = c("Homo sapiens", "Panthera"))
write_taxa_map(sample_taxa, scientific_name)
