\title{Create taxonomicCoverage EML node from taxonomic data}
\usage{
create_taxonomicCoverage()
}
\value{
A list 
EML-compliant \code{taxonomicClassification} nodes. The
function also writes \code{taxonomicCoverage.xml} to the working directory.
}
\description{
This function reads a taxa data file in the working directory
(taxa_map.csv) and generates EML-compliant taxonomicClassification node(s)
suitable for use with the EML R package. It uses \code{create_taxa_list()}
to generate a list of single-rank taxonomic classification records. The
resulting EML node can be incorporated as a taxonomicCoverage element as
part of a EML coverage. In addition to returning a list of
taxonomicClassification(s), the resulting content is written to
\code{taxonomicCoverage.xml} in the working directory.
}
\details{
The input taxa data file (\code{taxa_map.csv}) must contain at
least the columns \code{taxonRank}, \code{taxa_clean} (the value for the
specified rank), \code{taxonID} (e.g., "ITIS:12345" or "GBIF:67890"), and
optionally \code{vernacularName} (common names, possibly comma- or
semicolon-separated).

Only the rank specified in \code{taxonRank} is included for each record. The
function is robust to missing or empty \code{vernacularName} and
\code{taxonID} fields (these are omitted). The output is suitable for use in
EML metadata or other workflows requiring a flat, single-rank taxonomic
classification structure.

The name of the function is a bit misleading as it does not actually return
a taxonomicCoverage but rather a list of taxonomicClassification(s) that are
added to coverage as a taxonomicCoverage sensu
\code{coverage$taxonomicCoverage <- taxaCoverage}. taxonomicCoverage is part
of the title as that is the essence and taxonomicClassification could have
added a different confusion of suggesting that it constructs only a single
taxonomicClassification.

It is important to note that a taxonomic tree for each organism is not
generated. Rather, the function builds a `taxonomicClassification` element
for each taxon that features only the derived rank of the organism. For
example, if the taxon \emph{Larrea tridentata} is submitted, the output will
include content (authority, authority ID, and common name (if relevant)) for
that species. That is, the result will not include content related to the
family, order, class, etc. to which the organism is associated. This
approach is contrast to other tools, such as \code{taxonomyCleanr}, that
build a complete taxonomic tree.
